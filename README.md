# Project Title

This repository includes scripts that allow the user to conduct ultrasound experiments.  Scripts enable the users to align and calibrate ultrasound transducers and to control the insonation of these transducers on targets in 24 well plate platforms.

### Prerequisites

This system requires MATLAB with the Agilent VISA controller add-on installed.

## Getting Started

These scripts must all be in the same directory in order to function.  The results of any scans or acquisitions made by these scripts will be in a "results" subdirectory in this directory, so place this directory in a drive with sufficient available space.



### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
